    <h2>About Bags'R'Us</h2>
    <p>We are a small invented company that aims to supply bags to any shop that needs bags for its customers. <br>
    Our bags are customisable and sturdy, all that is needed to strive in today's world. <br>
    Furthermore, all materials are of recycled origin.</p>
    <h2>The Assignement</h2>
    <p>This website was created for the CSCU9B2 Assignement, in the second semester of the 2018/2019 academic year. Students had to create a website to "sell" carrier bags. A canvas should be used to draw a bag with text on it. There should be a choice of colours for both the bag and the text. The "order" button should create a popup that informs the user that the order has been placed.</p>
